# GASLinkPuller

A Google Apps Script project for pulling URLs from emails in a user-selected GMail label. Most useful when combined with 'memo' apps that hook into Android/iOS sharing functionality.

## Usage

On the opening of Google Spreadsheet with this script installed, a 'Link Puller' menu item is added. Under this item are 3 options:

###### Select GMail Label

Allows the user to select which GMail label the link puller will be checking.

It's recommended to combine this with an incoming messages filter on the GMail side for maximum automation.

###### Control Mail Checking

###### Manually Pull Messages
